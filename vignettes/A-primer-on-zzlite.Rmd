The `zzlite` package is a collection of functions that simplifies communication between R and the [Zamzar Online file conversion](https://developers.zamzar.com/user) API.  

By utilizing `zzlite` (and thereby the Zamzar API) you can easily convert between [hundreds](https://developers.zamzar.com/formats) of file formats from R.

## The basics

The following section serves as a simple introduction to get you started with the `zzlite` package. It is assumed that you already have a valid (and nonexhausted) Zamzar API key at your disposal. If not, go signup via [Zamzar](https://developers.zamzar.com/)s website. Otherwise, keep on reading.  


### On Zamzar API keys in `zzlite`

There's two ways in which you can pass a Zamzar key to `zzlite`.  

1. By passing a hardcoded Zamzar key as an argument to the `usr` parameter. The `usr` parameter is available in all functions that are communication with Zamzars webservice.  

2. By leveraging an `.Renviron` file. Simply create a variable called `ZAMZAR_USR` in your `.Renviron` and pass it your Zamzar key. If done succesfully, you can skip passing a key to `usr` param whenever you're invoking a `zzlite` function.

```sh
## Zamzar key used by zzlite 
ZAMZAR_USR=77c39dh6lo03g7598t98h659ihg99b7ny7213q
